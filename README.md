# lstm-spanish-translator

The notebook in this repo holds the starter code for an English - Spanish translator.
It's aim is to showcase the code and logic behind a basic LSTM LLM to begginers.

The notebook is based on the code I have written as part of the [Codeacademy: Language Models in Python: Generative Text](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/text-generation) course.

The training dataset was obtained from [ManyThings.org](https://www.manythings.org/anki/).
